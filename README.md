Water data SDK
==============

Functionality will focus on stream gauge data available from the following
agencies:

* United States Geological Survey
* United States Army Corps of Engineers

Specifically, initial functionality will focus on stream gauges, their current
levels, precipitation amounts, flood stage levels, discharge levels, and water
temperature.

Initial framework will be available for OS X 10.9+ and iOS 7+.

This framework is built for use with [FloodWatch for
iOS](http://floodwatchapp.com/), but is available as an open source
project under a BSD 2-clause license.
